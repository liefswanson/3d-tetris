to make this project and run it you will need glfw3

if you are on 14.10

sudo apt-get install libglfw3-dev libglew-dev clang
make -j4 run


if you are on 14.04
in order to make it available you need to add a ppa

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:keithw/glfw3
sudo apt-get install libglfw3-dev libglew-dev clang
make -j4 run

(or build it from source, but at that point i think i would just prefer to come by and demo it for you again)

ADDITIONALLY:
I assumed you would have build trouble again so i included a static library
this static library can be used to compile

by running...

make -j4 static-run

the one catch is that all the following libraries must be available
-lGLEW -lGL -lX11 -lpthread -lXrandr -lXi -lXxf86vm -lXcursor -lXinerama
.... i couldn't static link everything all of the xlibs unfortunately only so much space :-(


the compiler is set to g++
but in development i used clang++
